# Retro Arcade
## Created by: Shadman Hassan

This is a collection of classic, retro games built in Unity using C#.
Pong is the first fully finished game to be added to this collection.
Snake has also been finished and uploaded as well. I will periodically
add new titles as well as update old ones with new features and bug
fixes. So far, the plan is to implement:

 1. ~~Pong~~

2. ~~Snake~~

3. Missile Command

4. Asteroids

5. Super Mario Bros

For a retro game with a comedic twist, check out [Break In](https://github.com/shadmanh/Break-In)!
[Break In](https://github.com/shadmanh/Break-In) is my variation of the
classic game Breakout, with slightly more plot and infinitely more humour.

If you wish to run this program but don't have Unity installed, just
download either the BuildWindows folder or the BuildMacOSX.app folder,
depending on which OS you're running, and run the executable file.

You'll first start off at a game selection menu. Pick a game and it will
start to run.

Pong input is through the mouse.

Snake input is through arrow keys.

All games will reset once the max score is reached or you die.

You can quit to the menu using the escape key anytime.

Pressing the escape key at the menu screen will exit the application.
