# RetroArcade
## Created by: Shadman Hassan

This is a collection of classic, retro games built in Unity using C#.
Pong is the first fully finished game to be added to this collection.
I was hoping to add at least 2 games with the initial commit but I was
not able to develop a version of Snake that's to my liking in time.
Rest assured, they will be up soon. I will periodically add new titles
as well as update old ones with new features and bug fixes. So far,
the plan is to implement:

 1. ~~Pong~~

2. Snake

3. Missile Command

4. Asteroids

5. Super Mario Bros

For a retro game with a comedic twist, check out [Break In](https://github.com/shadmanh/Break-In)!
Break In is my variation of the classic game Breakout, with slightly more
plot and infinitely more humour.

If you wish to run this program but don't have Unity installed, just
download either the BuildWindows folder or the BuildMacOSX.app folder,
depending on which OS you're running, and run the executable file!
