# RetroArcade
## Created by: Shadman Hassan

This is a collection of classic, retro games built in Unity using C#.
Pong is the first fully finished game to be added to this collection.
I will periodically add new titles as well as update old ones with new
features and bug fixes. So far, the plan is to implement:

 1. ~~Pong~~

2. Snake

3. Missile Command

4. Asteroids

5. Super Mario Bros

For a retro game with a comedic twist, check out [Break In](https://github.com/shadmanh/Break-In)!
Break In is my variation of the classic game Breakout, with slightly more
plot and infinitely more humour.
